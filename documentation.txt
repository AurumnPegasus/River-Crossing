This game is designed as a 2 player game where the first player is given the icon of Spiderman and the second one is given the icon 
of Deadpool
The objective of the game is to cross the river and all the obstacles in minimum time possible
There are at max four rounds and whoever completes the fourth round first wins the game 
In the case both completing the rounds in the same amount of tries, then the criteria to judge the winner depends on the time taken by either to complete the challenge

For crossing a moving object a player gains 10 points whereas for crossing a static object a player gains 5 points

The first player moves using the Arrow keys, whereas the second player moves using the wasd keys
This is a very simple game and I hope you enjoy it
